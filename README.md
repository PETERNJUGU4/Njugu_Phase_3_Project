PREDICTING THE LIKELIHOOD OF H1N1 AND SEASONAL FLU VACCINES UPTAKE.
1. Project Overview.
Vaccination is a critical public health measure for preventing the spread of infectious diseases, including H1N1 and seasonal influenza. However, vaccine uptake can vary significantly across different populations due to factors such as access to healthcare, socioeconomic status, education, and cultural beliefs. In Kenya, understanding the predictors of vaccine uptake is essential for improving vaccination campaigns and ensuring widespread protection against these diseases.

2. Business Understanding.
2.1 Business Problem.
The year is 2024. There has been an outbreak of H1N1 and Seasonal Flu in the country. Various measures need to be put in place to curb the spread of the flu. Health providers are stressed by the situation because it is getting out of their hands, its very alarming and causing a lot of panic across all divides. As an experienced Data scienist, I have been hired by the Ministry of Health - Kenya (MoH-Kenya) to help them come up with models to help them predict how likely the citizens are to receive their H1N1 and Seasonal Flu vaccines and their perception of the same.

2.2 Stakeholders.
The main stakeholders of this project or rather the beneficiaries are The Health Providers such as Ministry of Health-Kenya, Hospitals and NGOs such as Centre for Diseases Control (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO). The models that I will come up with will enable them make informed decisions when rolling out vaccinations campaigns programmes across the country and eventually across the entire globe.

2.3 Objectives.
The main objective of this project is to predict whether or not respondents will receive the H1N1 and Seasonal Flu vaccines using machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Decision Trees Classifier.

Specific Objectives;

Examining whether doctor's recommendation has an effect on the vaccines uptake.
Come up with a Logistic regression and Decision tree classifier models to help predict vaccines uptake.

3. Data Understanding.
Data source
A vaccine for the H1N1 flu virus became publicly available in October 2009. In late 2009 and early 2010, the United States conducted the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey. This phone survey asked respondents whether they had received the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines, in conjunction with questions about themselves. These additional questions covered their social, economic, and demographic background, opinions on risks of illness and vaccine effectiveness, and behaviors towards mitigating transmission. A better understanding of how these characteristics are associated with personal vaccination patterns can provide guidance for future public health efforts.
